About: I chose to document the contextual information that was written on the page: the context of history is the key to understanding this letter, however, it’s easy to write down information about the well-known events that surrounded the writing of the letter (i.e., American Revolution, Boston Tea Party). Because the historical events that surround the letter will be important to explain, the metadata should focus primarily on what’s given to the reader within the document. That metadata will then create an easier bridge between the information on the letter and the ongoing events that surrounded its history. 

Text Extraction (10/20/2025): The OCR I chose to use, Adobe Acrobat, was extremely inaccurate. After subscribing, Acrobat had issues with my original file; I needed to convert to a PDF in order to scan the text. At first glance, there was issues between the number "zero" and the letter "O" along with misinterpretations of the letter "s" (in the 1773 text, "s" appears similar to "f" or "l"). I had to manually correct numbers to letters and turn a lot of charters into an "s". On the second read, I realized that the OCR has incorrectly spelt a handful of words where the original paper might've been worn down. I had to correct errors along these seams, and I completed additional reads to make sure the text matched the document. I ended up having to do a lot of text correction, and wish I had tried using ChatGPT, despite its inaccuracies in reading personal documents. There were no images or tables to transcribe, but I was disappointed by Adobe Acrobat's performance on the plain text in the letter.
